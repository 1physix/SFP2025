# SFP2025
Github Repo for my 2025 SFP Artefact - a nose tracked mouse

The main goals for this project to be considered successful, are as follows: 

  1. The software must reduce the need to actively use one’s hands to navigate a computer screen.

  2. The software must be able to conduct basic computer tasks, such as web surfing and simple digital art.
    
  3. The software must not be excessively laggy – it should run as smoothly as possible
